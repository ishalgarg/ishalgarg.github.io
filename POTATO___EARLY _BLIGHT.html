<h1> POTATO___EARLY _BLIGHT</h1>

<p>
<br> 
Cause-:<br> 
<br> 
Early blight of potato is caused by the fungal pathogen Alternaria solani. The disease affects leaves, stems and tubers and can reduce yield, tuber size, storability of tubers, quality of fresh-market and processing tubers and marketability of the crop.<br> 
<br> 
 Management-:<br> 
<br> 
Select a late-season variety with a lower susceptibility to early blight. (Resistance is associated with plant maturity and early maturing cultivars are more susceptible).<br> 
Time irrigation to minimize leaf wetness duration during cloudy weather and allow sufficient time for leaves to dry prior to nightfall.
Avoid nitrogen and phosphorus deficiency.<br> 
Scout fields regularly for infection beginning after plants reach 12 inches in height. Pay particular attention to edges of fields that are adjacent to fields planted to potato the previous year.<br> 
Rotate foliar fungicides (Table 1).<br> 
Monitor physiological days (P-Days) with the North Dakota Agricultural Weather Network (NDAWN) Potato Blight app.<br> 
Kill vines two to three weeks prior to harvest to allow adequate skin set.<br> 
Avoid injury and skinning during harvest.<br> 
Store tubers under conditions that promote wound healing (fresh air, 95 to 99 percent relative humidity, and temperatures of 55 to 60 F) for two to three weeks after harvest. Following wound healing, store tubers in a dark, dry, and well-ventilated location gradually cooled to a temperature appropriate for the desired market.<br> 
Rotate fields to non-host crops for at least three years (three to four-year crop rotation).<br> 
Eradicate weed hosts such as hairy nightshade to reduce inoculum for future plantings.<br> 
<br> 
Chemical Control--<br> 
<br> 
Since most commercially acceptable potato cultivars are susceptible to early blight, the application of foliar fungicides is the primary management tactic. Mancozeb and chlorothalonil are perhaps the most frequently used protectant fungicides for early blight management but provide insufficient control under high disease pressure. Therefore, the application of locally systemic and translaminar fungicides often is necessary for control at high levels of disease pressure, especially under irrigation.<br> 
<br> 
Fungicide selection and rotation should be approached with thought to obtain effective disease control and prevent the early blight pathogen from further fungicide resistance development.<br> 
<br> 
Rotate fungicides with different modes of action. Fungicides with the same mode of action should not be applied in consecutive applications.<br> 
<br> 
Refer to the most current “North Dakota Field Crop Plant Disease Management Guide” (PP622) for updated information on products, modes of action, and rates for application.<br> 
<br> 
Fungicide Resistance in Alternaria solani<br> 
Recent research conducted at NDSU by Bauske et al. (2018a) determined that fungicide resistance in the early blight pathogen to the Quinone outside Inhibiting (QoI) fungicides such as Quadris® and Headline® was highly prevalent. In a survey from 2015, the F129L mutation associated with QoI resistance was detected in 100 percent of isolates collected throughout North Dakota and Minnesota (Table 2). Cross resistance has been documented among many chemistries of the QoIs registered for early blight control in potato.<br> 
<br> 
Resistance to Succinate Dehyrogenase Inhibiting (SDHI) fungicides has also become problematic in recent years. Five different mutations have been characterized as conferring resistance to Endura® and Vertisan®, and the prevalence of mutations conferring high levels of resistance to these fungicides is increasing throughout North Dakota and Minnesota (Table 2).<br> 
<br> 
Resistance to the anilino-pyrimidine (AP) fungicide Scala® also has been reported in several states, including Minnesota (Fonseka and Gudmestad, 2016). The accumulation of fungicide-resistance mutations in the early blight fungus has been demonstrated to have no impact on the survival and parasitic ability of this pathogen (Bauske and Gudmestad, 2018), suggesting that resistance is stable and permanent in the A. solani population.<br> 
<br> 
To reduce the potential for fungicide resistance development in A. solani, we recommend that fungicides be tank-mixed and alternated with chemistries of different modes of action. This tactic is facilitated by the Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC) code number that can be found on every EPA label on the container (Table 1). Furthermore, selecting later-maturing cultivars, which are less susceptible to early blight, can reduce the number of fungicide applications needed to achieve adequate control.<br>
