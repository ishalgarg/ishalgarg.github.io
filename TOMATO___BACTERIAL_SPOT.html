<h1>TOMATO___BACTERIAL_SPOT</h1>
<p>
<br> 
Cause-:<br> 
<br> 
Bacterial spot is caused by four species of Xanthomonas and occurs worldwide wherever tomatoes are grown. Bacterial spot causes leaf and fruit spots, which leads to defoliation, sun-scalded fruit, and yield loss<br> 
<br> 
General Disease Management-:<br> 
<br> 
Skip to General Disease Management<br> 
Management of the disease focuses on preventive control measures throughout the season. Once a field becomes infested, bacterial spot is difficult to control, especially under conducive disease conditions. Therefore, preventative control measures are very important. Losses can be reduced by adopting the following management strategies:<br> 
<br> 
The most effective management strategy is the use of pathogen-free certified seeds and disease-free transplants to prevent the introduction of the pathogen into greenhouses and field production areas. Inspect plants very carefully and reject infected transplants- including your own!<br> 
In the greenhouse, discard trays adjacent to outbreak location to minimize disease spread.<br> 
Treat seeds with dilute bleach, hydrochloric acid, or hot water to reduce the potential for seedling infection. However, this seed treatment is not recommended for producers that use pelleted seeds as it will remove the pelleted coating from seeds. These treatments may also reduce seed germination. <br> Perform a test treatment on approximately 50 to 100 seeds and check for the effect on germination before treating an entire seed lot. For specific instructions and recommendations please consult the Southeastern US Vegetable Crop Handbook.<br> 
In transplant production greenhouses, minimize overwatering and handling of seedlings when they are wet.<br> 
Trays, benches, tools, and greenhouse structures should be washed and sanitized between seedlings crops.<br> 
Crop rotation should be used to avoid pathogen carryover on volunteers and crop residue. Avoid fields that have been planted with peppers or tomatoes within one year, especially if they had bacterial spot previously.<br> 
Eliminate solanaceous weeds in and around tomato and pepper production areas.<br> 
Keep cull piles away from field operations.<br> 
Do not spray, tie, harvest, or handle wet plants as that can spread the disease.<br>
