<h1>SQUASH___POEDERY_MILDEW</h1>
<p> 
	<br>
Cause-:<br>
<br>
Powdery mildew, mainly caused by the fungus Podosphaera xanthii, infects all cucurbits, including muskmelons, squash, cucumbers, gourds, watermelons and pumpkins. In severe cases, powdery mildew can cause premature death of leaves, and reduce yield and fruit quality.<br>
<br>
Preventing and managing the disease-:<br>
<br>
Plant varieties with complete or partial resistance to powdery mildew.<br>
Apply fertilizer based on soil test results. Avoid over-applying nitrogen.<br>
Provide good air movement around plants through proper spacing, staking of plants and weed control.<br>
Once a week, examine five mature leaves for powdery mildew infection. In large plantings, repeat at 10 different locations in the field.<br>
If susceptible varieties are growing in an area where powdery mildew has resulted in yield loss in the past, fungicide may be necessary.<br>
Apply fungicides after finding the first spot of powdery mildew.<br>
Home gardeners can apply sulfur products to both the upper and lower surface of the leaves.<br>
Commercial growers should refer to the Midwest Vegetable Production Guide for pesticide recommendations.<br>
