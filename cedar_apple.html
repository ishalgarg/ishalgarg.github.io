	<h1>CADER APPLE RUST</h1><br>
	<p>
		
Cause-:<br>
<br>
 This disease is caused by fungus "Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae".<br>
 Affects both cader and apple.<br>
 <br>

Treatment-:<br>
<br>
Choose resistant cultivars when available.<br>
Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.<br>
Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.<br>
Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.<br>
On juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October.<br>
Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.<br>
Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, BonideÂ® Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots.<br>
