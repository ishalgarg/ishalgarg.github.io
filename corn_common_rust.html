<h1>CORN_(MAIZE)__COMMON_RUST</h1>
<p> 
<br>
Cause-:<br>
<br>
Common rust is caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi and occurs every growing season.<br>
Rust pustules usually first appear in late June.<br>
<br>
Management-:<br>
<br>
CULTURAL CONTROL<br>
<br>
Maize rusts are generally controlled by the use of resistant maize hybrids, and by foliar applications of fungicides on sweet corn. Cultural practices may be effective in areas where rust spores can overwinter on debris or where infected Oxalis species are a source of spores. Therefore, collect the remains of the crop and destroy by burning or burying, and weed around maize plots if Oxalis is common.<br>
<br>
RESISTANT VARIETIES<br>
<br>
The use of resistant varieties is the best way of managing rust diseases. Two types of resistance exist: partial resistant and qualitative resistance. Partial resistance (or tolerance) results in fewer pustules, reduced sporulation, and lower germination rates. Disease spread and the development of epidemics are slower. Qualitative resistance is based on single genes providing total resistance. The trouble with this kind of resistance is that it may encourage the selection of new strains of the rust that can overcome varietal resistance.<br>
<br>
CHEMICAL CONTROL<br>
<br>
Fungicides have been used against both common and southern rust, but they are usually not needed in maize because of the resistance bred into commercial varieties. However, foliar fungicides may have a use on sweet corn. A number of protectant fungicide have been recommended: e.g., chlorothalonil or mancozeb. Plants are monitored and sprays commence when there are on average six pustules per leaf.<br>
