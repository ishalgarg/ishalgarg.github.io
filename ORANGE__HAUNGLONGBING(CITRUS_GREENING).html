<br>
Cause-:<br>
<br>
Citrus greening disease; lit. 'yellow dragon disease'; or HLB) is a disease of citrus caused by a vector-transmitted pathogen. The causative agents are motile bacteria,<br>
<br>
Control-:<br>
<br>
Some cultural practices can be effective in monitoring this disease. Cultural methods include antibacterial management, sanitation, removal of infected plants, frequent scouting, and most importantly, crisis declaration.[24] Tracking the disease will help prevent further infection in other affected areas and help mitigate more local infections if detected early enough. The Asian citrus psyllid has alternative hosts that may attract psyllids to citrus plants in the vicinity such as Murraya paniculata, Severinia buxifolia, and other plants in the family Rutaceae.[25]<br>
<br>
No cure for citrus greening disease is known, and efforts to control it have been slow because infected citrus plants are difficult to maintain, regenerate, and study. Ongoing challenges associated with mitigating disease at the field-scale include seasonality of the phytopathogen (Candidatus Liberibacter spp.) and associated disease symptoms, limitations for therapeutics to contact the phytopathogen in planta, adverse impacts of broad-spectrum treatments on plant-beneficial microbiota, and potential implications on public and ecosystem health.[26]<br>
<br>
No naturally immune citrus cultivars have been identified; however, creating genetically modified citrus may be a possible solution, but questions of its acceptability to consumers exist.[27] A researcher at Texas AgriLife Research reported in 2012 that incorporating two genes from spinach into citrus trees improved resistance to citrus greening disease in greenhouse trials.[28] Field tests by Southern Gardens Citrus of oranges with the spinach genes in Florida are ongoing.[27]<br>
<br>
A resistant variety of mandarin orange called 'Bingo' has been bred at the University of Florida.[29] Other varieties can have a partial tolerance to the disease.[30]<br>
<br>
Antibiotics<br>
<br>
Researchers at the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture have used lemon trees infected with citrus greening disease to infect periwinkle plants in an effort to study the disease. Periwinkle plants are easily infected with the disease and respond well when experimentally treated with antibiotics. Researchers are testing the effect of penicillin G sodium and biocide 2,2-dibromo-3-nitrilopropionamide as potential treatments for infected citrus plants based on the positive results that were observed when applied to infected periwinkle.[31] In June 2014, the USDA allocated an additional US$31.5 million to expand research combating citrus greening disease.[32]<br>
<br>
Certain antibiotics, specifically streptomycin and oxytetracycline, may be effective in the fight against citrus greening disease and have been used in the United States but have been banned in Brazil and the European Union.[33] In 2016, the EPA allowed use of streptomycin and oxytetracyclin on orchards with citrus fruits like grapefruits, oranges and tangerines in Florida on an emergency basis, this approval was expanded and broadened to other states for oxytetracycline in December 2018.[33][34] Further expansion of medically important antibiotics is proposed by the EPA but opposed by the FDA and CDC, primarily as antibiotic resistance can be expected to develop and impact human health.[33][34]<br>
<br>
Peptide<br>
<br>
University of California Riverside announced that geneticist Hailing Jin discovered a peptide capable of treating citrus greening disease. The university entered into an exclusive license with Invaio to develop an enhanced injectable version of the product.[35]<br>
