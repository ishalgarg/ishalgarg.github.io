<h1>PEACH___BACTERIAL_SPOT</h1>
<p> 
<br>
Cause-:<br>
<br>
	•  Bacterial spot is an important disease of peaches, nectarines, apricots, and plums caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. pruni.<br>
	• Fruit symptoms of bacterial spot may be confused with peach scab, caused by the fungus Cladosporium carpophyllium,<br>
<br>
Control-:<br>
<br>
 More cultivars are being developed, so check with your local extension office or nursery for new resistant varieties. Keep your peach trees healthy by properly pruning out any diseased or dead limbs and fertilize and water as necessary. Too much nitrogen can aggravate the disease. While there are no completely successful sprays for control of this disease, chemical spray with copper based bactericide and the antibiotic oxytetracycline have some effect used preventatively. Talk to your local extension office or nursery for information. Chemical control is doubtful, however, so the best long term control is to plant resistant cultivars.<br>
