	<h1>CHERY POEDERT MILDEW</h1><br>
	<p>
Cause-:<br>
<br>
 Powdery mildew of sweet and sour cherry is caused by Podosphaera clandestina, an obligate biotrophic fungus.<br>
 Mid- and late-season sweet cherry (Prunus avium) cultivars are commonly affected<br>

Treatment-:<br>
<br>
Cultural control -:<br>
<br>
Start looking for the first colonies about 1 week after the first irrigation.<br>
Remove and destroy sucker shoots.<br>
Keep irrigation water off developing fruit and leaves by using irrigation that does not wet the leaves. Also, keep irrigation sets as short as possible.<br>
Follow cultural practices that promote good air circulation, such as pruning, and moderate shoot growth through judicious nitrogen management.<br>
