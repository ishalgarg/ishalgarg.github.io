<h1>C0RN_(MAIZE)___CERCOSPORA_LEAF_SPOTGRAY_LEAF_SPOT</h1>
<p> 
<br>
Cause-:<br>
<br>
	• Gray leaf spot is caused by the fungus Cercospora zeae-maydis.<br>
	• Gray leaf spot is favored by wet humid weather<br>
	<br>

Management Strategies-:<br>
<br>
Management strategies for gray leaf spot include tillage, crop rotation and planting resistant hybrids.<br>
<br>
Fungicides may be needed to prevent significant loss when plants are infected early and environmental conditions favor disease.<br>
In order to best prevent and manage corn grey leaf spot, the overall approach is to reduce the rate of disease growth and expansion. This is done by limiting the amount of secondary disease cycles and protecting leaf area from damage until after corn grain formation. High risks for corn grey leaf spot are divided into eight factors, which require specific management strategies.<br>
<br>
High risk factors for grey leaf spot in corn:[16]<br>
<br>
Susceptible hybrid<br>
Continuous corn<br>
Late planting date<br>
Minimum tillage systems<br>
Field history of severe disease<br>
Early disease activity (before tasseling)<br>
Irrigation<br>
Favorable weather forecast for disease<br>
There are currently five different management strategies, some of which are more effective than others.<br>
<br>
Resistant varieties<br>
<br>
The most proficient and economical method to reduce yield losses from corn grey leaf spot is by introducing resistant plant varieties.[17][18] In places where leaf spot occur, these crops can ultimately grow and still be resistant to the disease. Although the disease is not completely eliminated and resistant varieties show disease symptoms, at the end of the growing season, the disease is not as effective in reducing crop yield. SC 407 have been proven to be common corn variety that are resistant to grey leaf spot.[19] If grey leaf spot infection is high, this variety may require fungicide application to achieve full potential.[20] Susceptible varieties should not be planted in previously infected areas (see high risk table).[21]<br>
<br>
Crop rotation<br>
The amount of initial inoculum will be reduced when a crop other than corn is planted for ≥2 years in that given area; meanwhile proper tillage methods are carried out. Clean plowing and 1-year crop rotation in the absence of corn allows for greater reductions of the disease as well. Note that conventional tilling can reduce disease but can lead to greater soil erosion.[21]<br>
<br>
Residue management<br>
Burying the debris under the last year’s crop will help in reducing the presence of Cercospera zeae-maydis, as the fungal-infected debris can only survive above the soil surface. Again this technique will aid in reducing the primary inoculum, but it will not completely eradicate the disease.[22]<br>
<br>
Fungicides<br>
Fungicides, if sprayed early in season before initial damage, can be effective in reducing disease.<br>
<br>
Currently there are 5 known fungicides that treat Corn grey leaf spot:[23]<br>
<br>
Planting Date<br>
The impact of GLS is more severe if plants are affected early in their development. Early planting can help reduce yield losses by ensuring the crop is at a later stage of grain fill when conditions are typically favorable for GLS development.[24]<br>
<br>
Headline EC (active ingredient: pyraclostrobin)<br>
Quilt (active ingredient: azoxystrobin + propiconazole)<br>
Proline 480 SC (active ingredient: prothioconazole)<br>
Tilt 250 E, Bumper 418 EC (active ingredient: propiconazole)<br>
Headline EC<br>
Headline is to be applied at 400–600 mL per hectare (ha). For optimal disease control, begin applications prior to disease development (see Disease Cycle).<br> This fungicide can only be applied a maximum of 2 applications/year. Ground and aerial application are both acceptable.[23]<br>
Quilt<br>
Quilt is to be applied at 0.75-1.0 L per/ha. Application of Quilt is to be made upon first appearance of disease, followed by a second application 14 days after, if environmental conditions are favorable for disease development (see Disease Cycle). Upon browning of corn sheaths, Quilt is not to be applied. This fungicide can only be applied a maximum 2 applications/yr. Ground and aerial application are both acceptable.[23]
Proline 480 SC<br>
Proline 480 SC is to be applied at 420 mL per/ha. This fungicide can only be applied a maximum 1 time/year. Only ground application is acceptable. A 24-hour re-entry time is required (minimum amount of time that must pass between the time a fungicide is applied to an area or crop and the time that people can go into that area without protective clothing and equipment).[23]
Tilt 250 and Bumper 418 EC<br>
Tilt 250 is to be applied at 500 mL/ha. Bumper 418 EC is to be applied at 300 mL/ha. Both fungicides are to be applied when rust pustules first appear. If disease is prevalent after primary application, a second application 14 days later may be necessary. Two weeks later, a third application can be made under severe amount of disease. Ground and aerial application are both acceptable.[23]
When spraying fungicides Quilt and Headline EC at 6 oz/a at tassel stage using a tractor-mounted CO2 powered sprayer using 20 gallons of water/acre, average yield was seen to increase.[25] The use of fungicides can be both economically and environmentally costly and should only be applied on susceptible varieties and large-scale corn production. In order to prevent fungal resistance to fungicides, all fungicides are to be used alternatively, switching fungicides with different modes of action. Pyraclostrobin (Headline EC) and azoxystrobin are Quinone outside Inhibitor (QoI) fungicides, whereas propiconazole and prothioconazole are DeMethylation Inhibitors (DMI) fungicides.[23]<br>
<br>
Weed control<br>
By removing weeds, above ground airflow to the crop is increased, relative humidity is decreased, and it limits infection at most susceptible times.[26]<br>
