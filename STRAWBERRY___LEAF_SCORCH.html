Cause-:<br>
<br>
Diplocarpon earlianum is a fungus that causes leaf scorch, one of the most common leaf diseases of strawberry. This ascomycete produces disk-shaped, dark brown to black apothecia (0.25-1 mm) on advanced-stage lesions on strawberry leaves and leaf residues (Heidenreich and Turechek). Mature apothecia contain asci interspersed with unbranched capitate paraphyses. Asci (55-90 x 15-20 µm) are oblong-cylindrical, short-stalked, and contain 8 spores each. Ascospores (18-28 x 4-6 µm) are hyaline, two-celled, and slightly constricted at the septum (Sutton, 1998).<br>

Management-:<br>

Skip to Management
In matted row or perennial strawberry systems, select a planting site with good air drainage and sun exposure. Cultivars resistant to leaf scorch may be available and need to be evaluated for specific horticultural characteristics. Plant new transplants frequently, and allow adequate spacing between them to increase airflow. Control weeds. Avoid amendment with supplemental nitrogen in spring, as this may enhance disease. Keep moisture levels down and avoid long wetness periods by monitoring irrigation schedules; if possible, use drip irrigation rather than overhead. Remove foliage and crop residues after picking or at renovation to remove inoculum and delay disease increase in late summer and fall. Fungicide treatments are effective during the flowering period, and during late summer and fall.<br>

In annual plasticulture production systems, the disease has not been observed to cause economic damage in fruiting fields and generally does not require action. Although symptoms may be on plants at the time of planting or soon after, the levels of disease are typically low and do not persist into the spring. In plug production facilities, high disease levels may affect the look of the plants and this decreased aesthetic value may impact sales.
