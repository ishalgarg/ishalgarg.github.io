	<h1>Black Rot Apple</h1><br>
	<p>
		Cause_-:<br>
<br>
Black rot is caused by the fungus Diplodia seriata (syn Botryosphaeria obtusa).
The fungus can infect dead tissue as well as living trunks, branches, leaves and fruits.
The black rot fungi survive Minnesota winters in branch cankers and mummified fruit (shriveled and dried fruit) attached to the tree.<br>
<br>

Treatment-:<br>
<br>
Prune out dead or diseased branches.<br>
Pick all dried and shriveled fruits remaining on the trees.<br>
Remove infected plant material from the area.<br>
All infected plant parts should be burned, buried or sent to a municipal composting site.<br>
Be sure to remove the stumps of any apple trees you cut down. Dead stumps can be a source of spores.<br>
